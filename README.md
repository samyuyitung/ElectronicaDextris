Have you ever heard of an _electronic_ Hurdy Gurdy

Well here's the code that powers ours

There are two parts 

1. The web interface
2. The actual instrument

### The instruemnt

it uses a tachometer (attached to pin A0) to control the crank
and a bunch of others to control the keys

I will update this by July 28th, 2018 with better info, but for right now this is what it does
